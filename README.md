### **Abstract:**
This project conducts a comprehensive multivariate analysis of HIV/AIDS patient data to identify key predictors of infection status and patient outcomes. The dataset encompasses a range of clinical, demographic, and treatment-related variables, including age, weight, hemoglobin levels, Karnofsky score, CD4 and CD8 counts, drug use, homosexual activity, and prior treatment history. Logistic regression modeling is applied to estimate the probability of infection, highlighting significant factors such as Karnofsky score, CD8 count, and drug usage in influencing patient outcomes. Seaborn is employed to visualize data distributions and relationships through scatter plots, heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots, aiding in the interpretation of variable interactions like the effect of age and weight on CD8 count. Outlier analysis and correlation heatmaps are used to refine the model and improve prediction accuracy. The findings provide deeper insights into the progression of HIV/AIDS and suggest factors critical for clinical decision-making, enhancing patient care strategies by identifying parameters closely tied to health outcomes. This analysis underscores the utility of data-driven approaches in understanding complex medical conditions.

### **Introduction:**

HIV/AIDS continues to present a substantial global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. Understanding the critical factors that influence disease progression and patient outcomes is essential for improving therapeutic interventions and patient management. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of an HIV/AIDS patient dataset to examine the relationships between clinical, demographic, and treatment-related variables and their impact on infection status.

The dataset includes important parameters such as age, weight, Karnofsky score (a measure of physical functionality), CD4 and CD8 cell counts, antiretroviral treatment (ART) history, and factors like hemophilia, homosexual activity, and intravenous drug use. The aim is to identify the most significant predictors of infection status using logistic regression, a statistical method suited for binary classification problems. Logistic regression allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors, providing insights into the relative importance of each variable in determining infection outcomes.

In addition to statistical modeling, data visualization techniques—primarily using Seaborn—are applied to explore distributions and interactions between variables. Scatter plots, heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots are employed to visualize key patterns, aiding in the identification of influential factors.

The primary goal of this study is to improve the understanding of HIV/AIDS progression and contribute actionable insights that may inform clinical decision-making, enhancing patient care. By identifying significant predictors of infection, the analysis offers a foundation for optimizing treatment strategies and managing patient outcomes more effectively.

### **Literature Review:**

Research into HIV/AIDS has extensively examined the clinical and demographic factors influencing disease progression and patient outcomes. Key indicators such as CD4 and CD8 cell counts, critical markers of immune system functionality, have been identified as significant predictors of health status in HIV-positive individuals. Elevated CD4 counts are generally associated with better immune function, while CD8 counts provide insights into immune response and disease progression. 

The Karnofsky Performance Status score, a widely used measure in oncology and infectious diseases, is another vital parameter. It evaluates physical functionality and often correlates with survival rates and quality of life in HIV patients. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has also been a central focus in HIV research, significantly impacting disease management. Different ART regimens vary in their efficacy, influencing immune recovery and viral load suppression. The interaction between drug combinations and patient outcomes highlights the importance of personalized treatment strategies.

In recent years, statistical models, particularly logistic regression, have become crucial in HIV research. Logistic regression is well-suited for handling binary outcomes such as infection status or treatment success, allowing researchers to manage multiple predictors simultaneously. This method provides a nuanced understanding of how clinical, behavioral, and demographic factors interact to affect health outcomes.

Advancements in data visualization techniques have further enhanced the ability to interpret complex datasets. Tools like Seaborn enable researchers to explore patterns and relationships between variables, such as age, weight, and treatment history. These visualizations complement traditional statistical analyses, offering intuitive insights into data trends and anomalies.

This project builds upon existing research by integrating logistic regression with advanced data visualization techniques to analyze an extensive dataset of HIV/AIDS patients. The goal is to further clarify the predictors of infection status and overall patient health, contributing valuable insights to ongoing efforts aimed at improving HIV/AIDS management and treatment strategies.
